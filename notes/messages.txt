Every message is composed by pkg name and msg type (pkg_name/msg_type) -> (std_msgs/String)
Example of type and field (in Twist)
Vector 3 --- linear
Vector 3 --- angular

 ---- Create custom message ---- 
1. Add it into folder "msg" (has to be created inside the pkg folder)
In the folder, add a .msg file containing the information of the message (type and field):
int32 id
string name
float32 temperature
float32 humidity

2. Update Dependencies in CMakeLists.txt (local not catkin one) add:
find_package(catkin REQUIRED COMPONENTS
roscpp
rospy
std_msgs
new_meeesage
)

3. Add name of file in CMakeLists.txt add (just update the add_messge_files already in file):
add_message_files(
FILES
message.msg
)

4. Update dependencies in package.xml, add:
<build_depend>message_generation</build_depend>
...
<exec_depend>message_runtime</build_depend>
