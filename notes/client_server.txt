Steps to Create a client/server ROS service app

Step 1: Define the Service message (service file)
Step 2: Create a ROS server node
Step 3: Create a ROS client node
Step 4: Execute the service
Step 5: Consume the service by client

We have to define the service message in the "srv" folder, in the project's folder.
The srv file is separated by "---", which means that the upper part is the request message, the lower is the response message. It is called the "service definition"
Example:
int64 a  
int64 b
---
int64 c

Dependencies must be updated as well:
In package.xml, add:
...
<build_depend>message_generation</build_depend>
...
<exec_depend>message_runtime</exec_depend>

In CMakeList.txt, add:
find_package(catkin REQUIRED COMPONENTS
	roscpp
	rospy
	std_msgs
	message_generation <- !
)

...
add_service_files(
	FILES
	AddTwoInts.srv
)

...
generate_messages(
  DEPENDENCIES
  std_msgs
)

Then do catkin_make
